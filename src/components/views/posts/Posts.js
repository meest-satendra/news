            "contentBody": "<p>Banjar is a small town in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh, popularly known as &quot;Valley of God&quot;. It connects Kullu to Shimla via Jalori Pass. The valley is also a gateway to Great Himalayan National Park. Banjar valley is the hub of many beautiful unexplored places. If you are not one of the Kasol crowds and want to spend time in peace with nature, this is the place for you. To get into the Banjar valley, continue past Banjar town without bypassing it and start following the Jibhi nala or stream. An alternate and more relaxed route is via Shimla if you have more days in hand and want to break your journey there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Banjar_HP_002.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banjar is around 27 km from Aut and is the biggest town and district headquarters of Banjar Valley &amp; Tirthan Valley. The road along the Tirthan river is very picturesque and provides a stunning view of the valley. From Banjar, the road bifurcates&amp;mdash; one road goes to Tirthan Valley and the other to Jibhi and Jalori Pass. Banjar Valley offers peaceful walks to tranquil villages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Banjar_HP_006.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gushaini is around 10 km from Banjar along the Tirthan river, while Jibhi is around 8 km from Banjar; a stream flows enroute Jibhi too. There is a big market in Banjar with all the necessities and even a bhuttico shop. It was the first town to be developed with guest houses and hotels. There are quite a few options for eating in Banjar, most of them clustered near the bus stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BUS STAND:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bus stand at Banjar is housed in a big building and has excellent connectivity with the rest of the valley and entire Himachal Pradesh. There are buses every 30 minutes to Tirthan Valley with Batahad being the last stop. Buses toward Jibhi, Sojha and onward to Jalori Pass are less frequent. Shared taxis ply toward Jalori Pass and on the other side to Anni village and there is also a taxi stand in Banjar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Banjar_HP_005.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tirthan River is a major river of Banjar along with the tributary Pushpabhad flowing from Jalori pass through Jibhi. It is located at the confluence of these two rivers. Banjar is one of the tehsils of the Kullu district. &#39;Banjar mela &#39; is the prominent fair of Banjar valley. A dialect of Kullavi called Saraji is spoken here and the people are also called Serajis. There are many tourist spots in Banjar, these are Tirthan valley, chehni fort for Shringa Rishi, Bahu village, Jibhi valley, Balu temple, etc. In 2020, Tirthan Valley is considered to be one of the most underrated tourist spots of Himachal Pradesh</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Its takes 7hour30 minutes (257.2 km) from Chandigarh to Banjar</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Places to see, ways to wander, and signature experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chehni Kothi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Religious Sites, Historic Sites</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chehni Kothi (or Chaini Kothi) is an impressive tower made of stone and wood. It has been named from the village where it lies: Chehni village. Chehni is located in the Jibhi valley near the Tirthan valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Banjar_HP_004.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to reach:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a jeepable road reaching the village but we suggest you to go on foot. It takes about 45 minutes or an hour to reach on foot from the main road depending on your stamina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can start walking either from the Shringa Rishi gate or from the villager Bihar. Both starting points are accessible from a link road located between Banjar and Jibhi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you want to go with your car be sure you are comfortable on steep and narrow mountain tracks. In case you stay in the Tirthan valley you will need to move to Banjar first and then continue towards Jibhi and Jalori pass. It is approx. a 45 minutes&rsquo; drive from Gushaini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shringa Rishi temple</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must know that the entire Kullu valley which includes the Tirthan valley is also called the valley of the gods. Almost each village has its own deity and there are plenty of natural places that are home to various gods. They are all recognized and respected by all the villagers of the Kullu valley. These gods are called Devta. All these Devta have their own story, and so there are gods who are more important than others. Shringa Rishi is the most important Devta of the Tirthan and Jibhi valleys. Shringa Risha stays in his temple located in the village Bagi, near Chehni Kothi. You can easily visit the temple while going to or coming back Chehni Kothi. The priest family living by the temple will be happy to tell you the epic story of Shringa Rishi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sai Ropa Tourist Center</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sai Ropa tourist centre is located just in the lap of nature, a 100m walk will take you to the river side. They have 4 rooms and dormitory for around 40 guests. Rooms are clean and spacious. Food is available but timings are limited. Walk around 50m you will find a 2 tea shops. Trek to choii waterfall is nearby. There are no big eateries around. You can enquire about the the great Himalayan national park trek and get further details from office in the centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only sore point is the souvenir shop which sells jams and squashes!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jibhi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jibhi_009.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:711px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jibhi is hardly a 2-hour journey away from Aut tunnel on the Delhi-Manali Highway. It lies in Banjar Valley and is at a distance of about 8-10 km from Banjar. There are lush green pine forests with a pristine waterfall in Jibhi. Jibhi is perfect for numerous short hikes close by and offers surreal mountain views encompassing traditional village life. Doli Guest House in Jibhi is an all-time favourite with travellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are quite a few places to stay in Jibhi and accommodation ranges from cottages to huts, to cheap homestays and guesthouses. Some of the top options to stay in Gushaini are the Rana&#39;s Cottage and Latoda Pine Huts that faces the river stream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Leena&rsquo;s Home, a homestay in Jibhi, is quite popular for delicious home-cooked food. Average rates for double rooms are around INR 500-800 for a night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sainj and Neuli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jibhi_0010.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:711px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The road to Sainj and Neuli bifurcates from Larji, just before Banjar. Larji Dam is close to Larji village and is the first place of note after the road diverges from Aut. The beauty of Sainj Valley has been tarnished a bit due to the hydroelectric power project that has been built over Sainj river.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sainj is a big town in the valley and Neuli is a small village. There are many homestays and guesthouses in both places. They are included in the region of the Great Himalayan National Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PLACES TO STAY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Banjar_HP_008.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Banjar and near by there are pleanty of private and locan guest house, cottages and hotels available which provides you good food, pleasant stay and serene ambience.

            "contentBody": "<p>The mirage-like golden city of Jaisalmer, in Rajasthan&#39;s Thar desert, conjures up images of an Arabian Nights fable. A former medieval trading center, the most notable characteristic of the town is the abundance of structures built using distinctive yellow sandstone&mdash;making any location a picture- perfect spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_003.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid the searing summer desert heat, it&#39;s best to visit between September and mid-March. The best time to experience the full splendor of the city is if you go during the annual Jaisalmer Desert Festival, usually held in early February or late January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The well said line in Bollywood movie-Kabhi aao humari haveli per! Explore Jaisalmer Fort and Palace Museum</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Jaisalmer fort</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_006.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaisalmer&#39;s ethereal sandstone fort, which resembles a massive sandcastle rising from the desert, is the city&#39;s focal point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort was built in 1156 by Rajput ruler Jaisal, who also founded the city at the same time. What really makes it unusual is that it&#39;s one of the few living forts in the world. Thousands of people reside inside its walls. It&#39;s also home to numerous hotels, guesthouses, temples, handicraft stores, restaurants, and the former maharaja&#39;s palatial palace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tickets cost 250 rupees for foreigners, including an audio guide. You&#39;ll need to pay 50 rupees extra to take your camera inside or 100 rupees for a video camera. Jaisalmer Magic runs a daily, three- hour heritage walking tour through the fort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the condition of the fort is deteriorating, as drain water is seeping into its foundations. Hence, many people choose to stay outside the fort in hotels with evocative views of the structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Jain temples at Jaisalmer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_010.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main attractions inside the fort is a stunning series of seven interconnected Jain temples that date back to the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carved out of sandstone, the detail on them rivals that of the marble Jain temple complex at Ranakpur. You&#39;ll need to remove your shoes and all leather items before entering. The temples are open daily from 8 a.m. until 12 p.m., although timings are prone to change, so do check first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tickets cost 10 rupees for foreigners, and while locals don&#39;t have to pay, there is a camera charge for everyone (50 rupees for camera and 100 rupees for video camera).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Walk Through Havelis</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_005.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upward view of Patwa ki Haveli, Jaisalmer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaisalmer is also known for the fairy-tale architecture of its magnificent historic havelis (mansions), located both inside and out of the fort. Many can be found in the narrow lanes about 10 minutes&rsquo; walk north of the fort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this area, the 19th century Patwa Haveli is the city&#39;s biggest and most important one. It&#39;s actually a cluster of five mansions built by a wealthy Jain trader and his sons. Kothari&rsquo;s Patwa Haveli is particularly impressive, with its breathtaking intricate stonework and artwork, and has been converted to a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entry fee is 100 rupees for foreigners and 50 rupees for Indians. In the same area, the distinctively shaped Salim Singh Haveli and extraordinary Nathmal Haveli are worth visiting as well. Inside Nathmal Haveli, the beautiful gold paintings are a highlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Ride a Camel</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_004.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most tourists take a camel safari&mdash;it&#39;s the quintessential Jaisalmer experience. A camel safari will also give you the opportunity to witness the rustic, rural desert life of India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s possible to go on a quick one-day safari or a hardcore safari as long as 30 days. However, choose the provider carefully as the safari business is extraordinarily competitive and tourists definitely get what they pay for. A few recommended vendors are Sahara Travels (next to the Fort gate), Trotters Independent Travel, and Real Desert Man Camel Safaris.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Sand Dunes and Desert National Park</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_012.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hordes of people head to the famous and picturesque Sam Sand Dunes, around 50 minutes west of Jaisalmer, at sunset. Cultural performances and camel rides create a carnival atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also possible to stay overnight close to the Sam Dunes in a unique, non-touristy experience by bunking at a desert camp for glamping. On the way to the Dunes, Kuldhara Abandoned Village is a spooky but interesting place to visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;d prefer a more peaceful desert sojourn, the dunes around Khuri village in Desert National Park an hour southwest of Jaisalmer are more suitable. Accommodations are available in traditional- style huts (Badal House is recommended for an authentic local experience) and small resorts. You can go on a camel safari there as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Eat Breakfast with Peacocks at Khaba Fort</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_007.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peacock in Rajasthan near Jaisalmer. If you don&#39;t mind getting up early, it&#39;s possible to have breakfast at the ruins of an old fort in the desert while marvelling over the remarkable spectacle of a huge flock of peacocks coming to be fed by a local boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The magnificent birds arrive at sunrise at Khaba Fort in an abandoned Paliwal village, about 40 minutes west of Jaisalmer (towards the Sam Sand Dunes). As well as seeing the peacocks, you&#39;ll get an evocative view over the village and can explore the fort afterward. To sign up, contact the luxurious Suryagarh Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Sunset point, Jaisalmer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Vyas Chhatri, on the edge of Jaisalmer north of the Fort, is dedicated to the great sage Vyasa who authored the Hindu epic The Mahabharata. This haunting place is used as a cremation ground for Pushkarna Brahmins and contains many cenotaphs (empty tombs) erected in honour of notable ones. The cenotaphs are referred to as chhatris because of their domes, which look like umbrellas (chhatris). Go there for spectacular sunsets over the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Bada Bagh at sunset in Jaisalmer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_008.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaisalmer has another group of similar looking cenotaphs, in a large unkempt garden around five kilometres further out, erected in honour of the city&#39;s royal rulers from the 16th to 20th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last cenotaph to be built is dedicated to Maharaja Jawahar Singh, who reigned after India&rsquo;s Independence. However, it remains incomplete due to his death a year after Independence, which was viewed as a bad omen by the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most intriguing are the plaques on the cenotaphs. The plaques showing both maharaja and maharani together indicate that the queen committed sati (threw herself on her husband&#39;s funeral pyre). In contrast to the cenotaphs, modern wind turbines now populate the breezy hill as well, to generate electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Paddle a Boat at Gadsisar Lake</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_009.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gadsisar Lake, also called Gadisar Lake, is a huge artificial reservoir built by Maharawal Gadsi Singh in the 14th century and situated on the southeast edge of the city. It provided the only water supply to the town until 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The many small temples and shrines that surround the lake make it an inviting place to relax and spend some time. Migratory waterfowl are an added attraction in winter, along with numerous catfish in the water that love to be fed. Boats are available for hire nearby too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaisalmer is known for its mirrorwork embroidered garments and carpets, blankets and shawls, woollen pattu, carpets made from camel hair, tapestry, oil lamps, finely cut antiques, old stonework, silver jewellery and silk and cotton textiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Jaisalmer_011.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several good restaurants in Jaisalmer you must visit on your trip. Not only good quality and authentic taste of food but also the splendid view which you can enjoy from several of the restaurants in Jaisalmer makes it worth visiting. It is sure to give you some amazing unforgettable memory. Foodies with every preference can find a place to dine in Jaisalmer.</p>\r\n",

            "contentBody": "<p>As you travel wide and far, you come across places that win your heart with sheer natural beauty &ndash; verdant landscapes, crystal-clear streams, snow-capped mountains, sandy beaches, lush-green hill stations and the like. And then there are places that lure you with an undeniable old-world charm and pay tribute to history through their very existence. Mysore, or Mysuru as it is called officially today, belongs to the second category, and rightly so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Mysore_003.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From palaces that talk about the glories of the bygone era and places of worship with rich cultural heritage to magnificent monuments and museums, every nook and cranny of Mysore has a story to say. Whether you are planning a weekend getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life or looking to tour South India, visiting the city will&nbsp;definitely be a surreal experience for the history buff in you. So, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the&nbsp;places to visit in Mysore in one day for a quick glimpse into its storied past.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Places to Visit in Mysore:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mysore Maharaja Palace (Amba Vilas)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nubit.in/api/upload/ckeditor_images/Mysore_002.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:700px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A trip to Mysore cannot be called complete if you don&rsquo;t visit the famous Maharaja Palace. In fact, the palace should rank top in your itinerary. Situated in the heart of the city, this iconic structure has mesmerized people from all over the world and now boasts of over 6 million annual visitors. This majestic palace used to be the royal residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and is known for its Indo- Saracenic architectural design. Stepping into this palace will make your jaw drop, both literally as well as figuratively. Such is its splendor! From the intricate designs on tall columns to the detailed roof artwork on the ceiling, the palace is a visual treat to the eyes. Plan your itinerary in such a way that you get time to watch the sound and light show in the evening to get a better understanding of the history of Mysore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or even better, plan your trip during the festival of Dasara which usually falls in the month of September or October. Mysore Dasara or Nada Habba is celebrated in the palace with much fanfare and joviality. The golden throne on which the great rulers of the Kingdom of Mysore sat is kept for display during this festival. You will find the palace packed with men and women dressed in festive wear.
